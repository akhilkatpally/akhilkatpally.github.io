Why in the whole world you wanted to idenitfy high quality denim jeans?  

**1. High quality denim lasts long time - cost savings, good for the environment.** 
**2. They fit exceptionally well to your body, because they adjusts to your body shape overtime.**
**3. They look exceptionally class - my opinion.**


 Below are some of the things to check for high quality denim.
 **1. Check the Weight of the jeans. Heavier == high quality. Anythign greater than 12oz(340grams) is heavy jeans.**
 **2. Check the Wrinkles on the denim - avoid buying laser made wrinkles, they look cheap and not natural**
 **3. Check the Distance between the stiches. They should be smaller and there should be 2 parallel stiches**
 **4. Too much streach == bad quality denim. High Quality denim generally has less than 2% strech, material used for streching needs to be less than 2%**
