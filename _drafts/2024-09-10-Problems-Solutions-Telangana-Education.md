How to include CSR and other donations to the schools to buy some infrastructure like computers, furniture, smart boards etc. 


**Create a website where people can donate to the schools in their area**

Education System for the Technologically Advanced Modern World:

After State Government services like ration card or pensions or me seva services ... education has highest number of customers. 


Purpose of the Education: 

Main purpose of education is to make students think and ask questions. One common event which keeps recurring in my mind when I think of education system in Telangana is students repeating after teacher saying A for Apple, B for Ball etc. You go to any elementary classes you could hear those chanting of the students without really understanding what they are. Ideally teacher should be asking students what do you know of words starting with A or B. This gives students an opportunity to think and answer, even if it is wrong it is ok. I think this is much more deeper problem than it displays. Since we don't speak English language from childhood, we don't hear that many words while growing up, it becomes difficult for children to recollect those words when teacher asks the questions. Every year the vocabulary of English words we use in our common language keeps increasing and it would be smaller problem every year. 

(Disclaimer: I am not against any religion or faith). 
One more problem which is deeply imbibed in our culture is Sanskrit slokas which pujaris chant or speak. We have taken for granted that they chant something and we repeat it without really understanding and would never bother to asks or understand their meaning. 

On a much deeper level I think having too many languages to learn also has some contribution to it. But also there are some evidence that learning/knowing multiple languages is better for brain. I am not sure how conclusive this is.





Examination System
Lowest hanging fruit to improve the education system is to fix the examination system. Simplest example is CBSE vs State Boards examination styles. Telangana Examination system is more memory based and rote learning based. Simplest way to improve the system is change the examination from pen and paper to computer based examination. Computer based examinations gives us freedom to completely reimagine how you can test students, instead of memorizing, rote learning and writing at the time of examination. You can test the same subjects visually or graphically or in a classical way. 
It is difficult to implement this for all classes of students and also in rural areas. Best students for this is engineering students especially computer science to start of with. 
For Engineering Students, it is better to move to a more practical based examination system. For example, in a coding class, you can give them a large code which contains bugs in it and ask them to debug and fix it. Main reason why engineering students are not hirable is because the whole system is not practical based. Everyone know that you can mug up last 3 years of question papers and get good grades. 


Syllabus: 

I also feel, State Syllabus has too much concepts and subjects. I don't think knowing that many would be helpful in fact it is harmful for majority of the students. Focus of the teachers have shifted from development of skills to the students to completion of the portion. Goal of the education system should be to help student develop the skill of learning not simply covering wide range of concepts. 

There are definitely some bright students who would want to learn advance concepts, having either advanced classes for them separately or guiding them in the right direction would be enough. 


Role of Technology in Education:



How to Imbibe Good Communication Skills at a very young age: 

One aspect of Education System is to learn how to think, asking questions, how to learn but another major aspect of it is how to express what you have learned. 
IT could be orally either through presentation or informally.
    â€¢ I do see this problem in majority of the students, generally it is wrongly attributed to English language but it is much more than that. Teaching this at a very young age would make night and day difference in a students life. Learning something at a very young age is very easy compared to learning at adult life.  
It could be on a written format. 
This is consistently tested through the examinations. 

Oral presentaion from a very young age should be part of examination, not in a final exam but definately at the mid terms. If possible it should be a seperate class where a student should be on their presentation skills, oral presentation is very time taking, so creating a seperate class for this will definately not disturb the individual class subjects. 

Sports System in Schools: 
How Moneytary incentives for individual schools when they win a sports competition and also quota based system for college admissions or jobs for students would be a good motivation for schools to focus on sports. 

We all know how sports help in physical and mental development of children.
